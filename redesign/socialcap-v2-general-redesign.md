Trello: [Roadmap 2024 03-6](https://trello.com/b/xpX9F2IY/roadmap-2024-03-06)

### Main Goal

The **main goal for the redesign is "User acquisition"**. May be achievable in many ways: by incorporating "invite and earn" buttons, highlighting newly added communities, reviewing content aimed at user acquisition, etc.

**IMPORTANT**: we must consider what will be possible and what we will want to do AFTER finishing the advancements of the next three months, and not just focus on what we can do now. We should plan with that idea in mind and not based on current limitations!

## Branding

Establish clear branding guidelines:

- **`Socialcap`** and NOT "SocialCap" OR "Social Cap" OR "Social cap" etc...

- Create a basic brand usage manual: well-established colors and typography.
- Provide necessary graphic assets (logos, favicon, etc.) according to usage (App, Twitter, LinkedIn, Discord, Landing).
- Provide branding guides for partners (such as ZKOK) 

## Marketing aspects

There are many marketing aspects to consider and define today that affect this Goal:

- It's necessary to clearly define who our potential "customer" is. Who makes the decision to use Socialcap? Why do they decide to do so? How do they make that decision?

- What would be our strategy for user acquisition? I don't think is NOT clear yet.
- Today we do not have and cannot offer "tokens" of Socialcap. But would that be a way?
- Ways to motivate/reward admins/projects that create their community on Socialcap?
- Ways to motivate/reward users who spread the use of Socialcap?
- Ways to motivate/reward users who use Socialcap? Why do they use it?
- Do we need other wallets for this? Or do we limit ourselves to the MINA community for now?
- Can we "suggest/create" credentials that are of interest to a certain project to promote its use? For example, "ProofOfContinuosUse," "ProofOfCommunityInvolvement," "CommunityHelperHero," etc... I mean, when you create your community you can easily get already done templates for this credential programs.
- We would need to showcase some particular use cases for "suggested" credentials for a project.

**MAY NEED TO CHECK AND REVIEW MARKETING PLANS**

## Landing

### Goals

The **main goal for the redesign is "User acquisition"**. May be achievable in many ways: by incorporating "invite and earn" buttons, highlighting newly added communities, reviewing content aimed at user acquisition, etc.

Secondary goals:

- Improve and potentiate coordination with Twitter, Discord & Linkedin. Both on content and styles.

- Hilite and "brag about" all that has been achieved in the last months: being part of the Navigator program, running in production for six months, winning Cohort 3 proposal, being an established member of the MINA community. etc. 

- We must show that we are clearly not where we started and the landing should show that. And where we are heading now.

Some "rough ideas" about this:

- It may be good to showcase communities and credentials here, the issue that we still have a small number may be overcome fairly easily and quickly, so this should not be an impediment for doing it. 
- One possibility is some alliance with ZKOK (https://zkok.io/) and showcasing its projects, after creating a link to each community. This requires some relationships effort ... 
- It may be good if we can go to the specific "community page" easily from here. 

### Fixes

These are fixes needed for the current page that may be included, ignored or superseded by the redesign. Listed here just as a reference.

- [Fix links to social medias](https://github.com/Identicon-Dao/socialcap/issues/78): Some of the links may we wrong or outdated
- [Finish terms and conditions](https://github.com/Identicon-Dao/socialcap/issues/76): Write a Terms and Conditions of use, also set Copyright limitations, etc. May need some help for lawyers ? Can MINA Foundation help ?
- [Landing page has no redirection to dApp](https://github.com/Identicon-Dao/socialcap/issues/68): Change the "Join Waitlist" button to a link to "my.socialcap.app"
- Remove "Join waitlist" section

- Remove carrousel and replace with something ? (Nico)
- Redesign Why (Nico) 
- New content for Why (Mario & Leandro) 
- New content for Navigators, Mina, Cohorts !!! (Leandro & Mario)
- Show Navigators Program and other communities
- Insist on privacy, etc features
- Renew Team
- Improve FAQ (Mario & Leandro)
- Setup Doc site links

## Social media (CM)

### Goals

Two objectives here:

- User acquisition
- Spread and raise awareness about Socialcap

Fixes and tasks

- Align styles and content with the Landing page
- Create "pre-designed" templates for posting tailored to each channel
- Provide all necessary graphic assets
- Define a review process before posting on each channel!
- Clarify which aspects we want to prioritize in dissemination: Social consensus, Credentials, Voting?
- Can we create a posting methodology that adapts relatively well to each channel with minimal changes to optimize our limited resources?

Channels

- Twitter: for spreading ideas, concepts, and news related to Socialcap.
- Discord: for technical support, questions, and dissemination in groups that are already users.
- LinkedIn: related to the use of Socialcap in companies and web2 communities.

## App UI

### Goals

We have tree great goals here:

- **Simplify the administration and monitoring of communities** and master plans. Community admins are among the critical users of Socialcap, so assisting them contributes to the utilization and expansion of Socialcap.

- **Facilitate user acquisition** by considering features to include in the app: home design with invite buttons, community page with easy "invite to these communities" buttons, the ability to link standalone community pages to other apps, etc.

- **Empower the users of Socialcap** who are requesting a credential and those who have obtained it, **so they can proudly display it to others using Socialcap**, thus contributing to its utilization and expansion.

### General requirements

- Support mobile and responsive layouts
- Add styling consistency to lists, tabs, forms, etc 
- Fix "branding errors" 
- Add user requested features
- Improve navigation for Admins
- Improve reuse of Masterplans for Admins
- Empower user's submission and view of own credentials
- Provide a clear path for monetization
- Improve visibility of Voting process

### Detailed features

We describe the full feature set in detail in a separate document: [Socialcap v2 - App UI Redesign](./socialcap-v2-app-ui-redesign.md)
